# MOEA-D-FD
This project is for dealing with dynamic multiobjective optimization problems(DMOPs) using a Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm.
We proposed a prediction model for the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). The model was combined with MOEA/D, and it is developed for those predictable DMOPs.
The code was executed by Matlabï¼Œand FDA1 benchmark was taken as an exemple for solving.
